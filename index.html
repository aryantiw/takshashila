            <h2>Our Aim</h2>
            <p>The project's goal is to develop content for 'Primary School Students' in order to stimulate their interest in mathematics, physics, and a variety of other valuable fields through perception so that they can lead their lives blissfully.</p>

            
                <p>
                    Takshashila name is derived from an ancient indian university which was the largerst university of its time many great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and authors came from it. Many students from across the globe too visited this largest university to study.
                    Literally meaning “City of Cut Stone” or “Rock of Taksha,” Takshashila was founded, according to the Indian epic Ramayana, by Bharata, younger brother of Rama, an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. The city was named for Bharata's son Taksha, its first ruler.

            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>
             We at takshashila strive to teach primary school kids science and mathematics to develop a thinking process in there brains as meaning of education isn't only to mug up all the concepts and jot them down on the examination paper, but education means to give students a idea of how the world works based on the concepts which are in the books.
